# MISiS2019ANN_2
Neural Network introduction at MISiS (Moscow), Tutorial 2


In case of any problems, contact us via:
 - Jonas Eschle: jonas.eschle@uzh.ch
 - Davide Lancierini: davide.lancierini@uzh.ch
 
_The slides used during the turorial are just the Jupyter Notebooks ".ipynb" found in this repository. They can be saved as slides for presentation purpose_

## Preparing for the Tutorials

 - Follow the steps below to setup the Ipython notebook
 - Make sure this worked and report if any troubles arise
 
If you prefer, you can also run it locally or on the machine of your choice. Feel free to download the notebooks, data and setup the right environment (there is an anaconda environment included in the repo).

## Google Colab Setup

In order to run the tutorials, it is recommended to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
Open the link (if needed log yourself in) and select the tab "Github". There, search for "zurich-ml/MISiS2019ANN_2"
and four Ipython Notebooks should show up. One is from the lecture and with "_solution" is the same notebook "with a solution". Click on them and the notebook will open.

### Using a GPU

In order to speed up training, we can even use GPUs! Select on "Runtime"->"Change Runtime Type" and then select the "Hardware Accelerator" to be a GPU. Connect again in case it does not do automatically.

## Data
 
You don't have to download the data directly but it's done automatically in the notebook.
